Pebble Technologies was created in 2023 by a team of engineers who shared a passion for all things digital. The team consists of a set of engineers with over 50 years of combined experience in top-tier semiconductor companies spawning multiple areas such as communications, networking, graphics and many more. The company is based in Athens, Greece but has members in various location over the world.

Pebble Technologies offers a wide range of services in the fields of digital design focusing on the development of efficient solutions for a multitude of target technologies. We can tackle any project ranging from implementing an existing specification or optimizing an existing design to seeing a project all the way from the concept phase to a prototype and then to a final verified solution both on ASIC and FPGA technologies.

This GitHub repository stands as a demo of our work and a place to share our ideas in digital design/verification targeting ASIC and FPGA implementations.
